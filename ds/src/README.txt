Welcome to my C language via linux project repository,
Each of the folders _in_ this repository contains a Makefile. 
All you have to do is:
1. Select a folder (I recommend to start with "sched")
2. Download the folder to your linux;
3. Run the makefile.
4. You can compile the "test.c" file too.

Best
