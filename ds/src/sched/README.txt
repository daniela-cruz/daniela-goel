TASK SCHEDULER
This scheduler is designed to time tasks from the stack pop up queue (pq.h).
sched.c which is the primary source file, used doubly linked list (dll.h). 
You can use your own dll.h or: DOWNLOAD my dll from this repository: https://github.com/daniela-cruz/daniela-goel/tree/master/ds/src/dll
It issues user id for each task (uid.h). 
The methos of sorting is Heap (heap.h).

Feel free to use the test files in this repository to run a simulation.
Best,
